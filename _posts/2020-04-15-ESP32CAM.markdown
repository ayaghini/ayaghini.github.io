# Intro

When it comes to camera, I have been a big-time fan of **Raspberry Pi Cameras**. They are less than $5 if you get them from our friends in China and have a decent image quality (I am talking about ver. 1). 

Recently I purchased couple of **ESP32-CAM** modules while I was shipping for something else (these days you can save on shipping if you buy all you can think of, maybe later we find a use for them!!).

Seems like they have all you can ask for:
- ESP32 as the processor
- A tf slot card reader
- wi-fi enabled
- BLE
- and even a small flash!

As you expected, they are also cheap (I got them for $6 CAD). 

I got them a shot today and found them super easy to work with, the image quality is not impressive but please look at the form factor and price, can you complain? 

I already have couple of use for them in my projects and will keep them in my reach for near future!
