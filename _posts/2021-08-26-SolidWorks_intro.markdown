# Discussion

It certainly is not a complete product if you cannot ship it to your customer in a presentable format. One must go through the product development procedure from very first step of putting together the **Schematics** all the way to the finished solution inside an enclosure. 

This is straight forward if it is planned ahead, and the team are aware of their workflow. ***[SOLIDWORK](https://www.solidworks.com)*** is a powerful tool that enables the team to import the 3D model of the designed PCB and components.

It is critical to visually check the alignment of I/O ports and any other mountable parts the design may include before approving and finalizing the part. For many parts manufactures provide their CAD and **[McMaster](https://www.mcmaster.com)** also has a good collection of CAD design that can be directly imported to the software.


An enclosure usually has many bits and pieces that without a proper CAD design and modeling it would be very easy to make a mistake. Also, there are aspects of a product such as port accessibility and arrangement, LED and user feedback layout, and in our industry case (i.e., ***MINING***) mounting in a harsh environment etc. that a CAD simulator software is invaluable.
