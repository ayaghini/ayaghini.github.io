# Intro
I recently started my journey into HF bands, as HAM operator with Honor license I can transmit wide open but watching people dealing with massive antennas which is by the way what has to be done in HF kept me want to maybe try it later!

HF bands are beautiful as their frequencies bounce off of different layers of atmosphere and enables people to talk to each other all around the world.

I finally made the move and bought my first HF rig. A YEASU FT-818ND. It is a well-known QRP radio means that only puts 6 watts output and has been around for almost 20 years. 

My immediate intention is to explore digital in this band. It is fascinating that there are beacons and stations that listens to you and provide signal report.

I am currently designing a utility protection for it which will come on-line quickly.
