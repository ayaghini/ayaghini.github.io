If you happen to be like me and have one of those old good USB printers laying around your house, you perhaps have already though of replacing it with a network printer and bring the comfort of printing wirelessly from anywhere to your family! if that's the case, let me share a simple project with you.

Everything started when because of COVID-19 my wife had to work from home and needed the printer too. You can imagine that sharing a USB cable was a nightmare. So, I decided to use what I have and not buy another piece of equipment.

A little research and I found that thanks to **Apple CUPS** it's possible to use **Raspberry pi** and add the network functionalities to an old USB printer.

There are tons of tutorials on the internet, before you go ahead and start working on the project, make sure your printer is supported!
