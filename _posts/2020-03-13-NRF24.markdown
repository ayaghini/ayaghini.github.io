NRF24 is a very cheap 2.4 GHz wireless module. Thanks to its reliability and price point it is very common for applications wanted to stay within ISM and not use regular Wi-Fi. 

I had many difficulties connecting my sensors and nodes to the gateway and I was getting ranges no more than 2-3 meter. Using the fix below helped:

In summary, the problem comes from the module antenna design and the fix just modify it. There are some NRF24 modules that you can connect external antenna and my test confirmed they are much better!
