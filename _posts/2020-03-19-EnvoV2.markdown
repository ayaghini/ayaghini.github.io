## Introduction

This project aims to automate and enhance the process of monitoring indoor air quality. The following parameters re monitored, stored and being transferred to my server:
1. Temperature
2. Carbon monoxide CO
3. Nitrogen dioxide NO2 
4. Ethanol C2H6OH 
5. Hydrogen H2
6. Ammonia NH3
7. Methane CH4
8. Propane C3H8 
9. Iso-butane C4H10 
10. PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10

I am using the same architecture as the post #1. The NRF24 is used for the data transfer to my Gateway. 

## My Take

I found the **Sharp** sensor easy to integrate but not very accurate, a reason could be the fact that mine didn’t come with a fan to circulate the air within the sensor optic, one needs to investigate it.

**Misc-6814** is a typical MEMS sensor that can detect the presence of multiple gases and the shortcoming is that it cannot tell you which gas. The sensor also needs calibration. 

**Dallas ds18820** is amazing, whether it needs some calibration would be my question!

The **Arduino pro mini** is performing very well!

last but certainly not least, the **10 segments LED** is very useful and also easy to implement using the **74HC595**, I was lucky to have couple of those around! 

## Sensors
## Sharp GP2Y1010AU0F Dust Sensor
This is an optical air quality sensor, with an analog output proportional to the measured dust density, with a sensitivity of 0.5V/0.1mg/m3.

*Below is a code I borrowed from the URL in the comment section, all credits go to authors.*

## MICS-6814
This is a compact MEMS sensor with three independent sensing elements on one package.

You can find the datasheet here: [MISC-6814](https://www.sgxsensortech.com/content/uploads/2015/02/1143_Datasheet-MiCS-6814-rev-8.pdf)

and to learn more about how to work with this sensor: [MISC-6814 Project](http://kstobbe.dk/2019/02/16/esp32-pms5003-bme280-mics6814-sensor-build/)

## Dallas DS18820

This is a famous temperature sensor. Please have a look at Arduino project here: [DS18820 Project](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/TheGadgetBoy/ds18b20-digital-temperature-sensor-and-arduino-9cc806)

## 10 Segments LED
To provide user with some sort of visual feedback, I decided to use one of these 10 segments LEDs I had around for ages. 

To use them I needed to use **74HC595 - Serial to Parallel Converter**. Adafruit has a great tutorial: [Adafruit Shift Register](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-4-eight-leds/overview)
