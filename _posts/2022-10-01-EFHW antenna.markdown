# Intro
One of beauties of HF and especially QRP is that you get to build your own antenna. For the first try I went with [KM4ACK](https://km4ack.square.site/product/49-1-efhw-antenna-kit/34?cp=true&sa=true&sbp=false&q=false) amazing antenna! It was out of stock, so I had to improvise. 

He has a great video explaining how to create the main part which is a 49:1 transformer. 

The 3d printed wire winder is what you can find fairly easy based on what you like on the internet and I used this [EFHW 3D printed winder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4914094/files).

The Triode is also important, luckily, he provides the specs, and it took couple of minutes to find the one I was looking for [online](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/fair-rite-products-corp/5943001701/8594079). I used one of BNC connectors I had but they are everywhere.


Remaining would be a real-world experience.
