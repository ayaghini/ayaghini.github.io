# Intro
Long distance communication had been the humanity biggest desires and from some point in history has become one of our spices most powerful tools.

Maybe that's why any project remotely related to wireless commiunication grabs my interest.

*LoRa* was introduced by [Semtech](https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora) with a very specific mission in mind, low-bandwidth long range communication or as we call it here **IoT** devices!

There are many long range data transfer records you can find asking Uncle Google, but the one I am aware of are exceeding 1000Km!

I am using them in couple of my projects, I wii share them in upcomming post...
